    <h1>My favorite TV show</h1>
    <p>Better Call Saul what I think is one of the best TV show I ever watch, maybe even better than Breaking Bad in mine opinion. The suspend and dramatic nature in the stories, but also the character development of Saul, also know as Jimmy throughout the season. But undoubtedly one of mine favorite charcater in the show despite not appear a lot is Nacho.</p>

A spinoff of Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul is a neo-noir crime drama that chronicles the gradual transformation of earnest, but ethically flexible, lawyer Jimmy McGill into the flamboyant, morally bankrupt criminal defense attorney Saul Goodman. The series, which mostly serves as a prequel, begins with Jimmy as a struggling public defender in Albuquerque, trying to escape his past as a con artist known as "Slippin' Jimmy". As he navigates a complex relationship with his older, highly respected brother Chuck, and forms a partnership with fellow lawyer Kim Wexler, a series of betrayals, poor decisions, and brushes with the criminal underworld push him further down a destructive path. Simultaneously, the show follows the parallel moral decline of former police officer Mike Ehrmantraut, who becomes an enforcer for drug traffickers, including the menacing Gus Fring and the Salamanca crime family. Ultimately, the series follows Jimmy's journey as he fully embraces the Saul persona, culminating in a poignant ending that takes place after the events of Breaking Bad and explores the consequences of his actions.</p>
